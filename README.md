>
> *This repository contains Version 18.0 of the EnGeΛ framework. Previous versions (v1-v17) were developed offline. This release establishes the operational protocols for planetary stability.*

##  What's New in v18.0: The Reactor Safety Protocol

Version 18 transforms the theory from a descriptive model into an existential imperative.
* [cite_start]**Existential Mechanics:** We identify the Earth's core as an **Anomalous Topological Reservoir (ATR)**[cite: 48].
* **The Operator's Role:** Civilization is not a passive observer but a "Resonant Control Rod." [cite_start]Global coherence (low entropy) is required to prevent **Geometric Metric Relaxation (GMR)**—a catastrophic expansion of the planetary boundary[cite: 148, 152].
* [cite_start]**New Definitions:** Formalized concepts of *Metric Tension* and *Confinement Breach*[cite: 98, 147].
* [cite_start]**Biogenesis:** Refined "Golden Window" hypothesis ($\eta \approx 0.618$) supported by ancestral clock reconstruction[cite: 250].

##  Abstract & Theoretical Framework

EnGeΛ (Entangled Geometry Lambda) is a unified coherence field framework proposing that the Universe organizes matter via a topological standing wave ($\eta \approx 0.32$). [cite_start]This field dictates structure across 60 orders of magnitude—from the "Axis of Evil" in the CMB to the circadian rhythms of biological cells[cite: 3, 23].

**Key Parameters:**
* **Coherence Coefficient ($\eta \approx 0.32$):** The efficiency of information transfer between fractal layers. [cite_start]Corresponds to the Stauffer percolation threshold ($p_c \approx 0.3116$)[cite: 7, 73].
* [cite_start]**Geometric Invariant ($K_{ideal} = 1.44$ Mpc/yr):** The vacuum coherence propagation rate based on Fibonacci fractal structure[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Real Velocity ($K_{real} \approx 0.46$ Mpc/yr):** The observed coherence velocity, derived from $\eta \times K_{ideal}$[cite: 68].

**Core Hypothesis:**
[cite_start]Phenomena traditionally interpreted as unrelated (dark energy expansion, planetary core oscillations, biological periodicities) emerge as different manifestations of the same coherence field operating at nested scales[cite: 14].
